HOW TO RUN - Clone the repository. Import the file into Postman UI. Run the tests.

PUPROSE OF TESTS - To ensure all fields are returned and to check the data in the returned payload. NB. I have not used all the numbers provided in the information provided for the test. EG: Nuumber of Followers was quoted as 21 but using 21 resulted in a failed test. Failed tests won't be useful as a starting point so I changed it to 19 so the test passed. It might not be a suitable test long term, because this figure could change daily and ergo tests will need to updated daily.

NOTE - We don't usually include Headers in our tests, but I have included one here just for demonstration purposes.
